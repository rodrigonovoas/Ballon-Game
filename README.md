This is my second mini-game done with Godot Engine.
In this game I create a simple system which consits in spawning balloons and enemies.
When you touch an enemy, you lose a health point, and when a balloon escapes, you lose one point too.
So, the goal of the game is holding up as much as you can.

Some features you can see in this game:
- Simple .txt save system.
- Enemy/balloon spawn system (based on node with timers)
- First time playing meessage.
- Audio manipulation.
